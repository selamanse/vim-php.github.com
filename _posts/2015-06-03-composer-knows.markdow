<p>I work with vi since late 2014. Starting from that date, I've learned different ways to work with this amazing and customizable editor. Since few weeks ago, I always worked with CtrlP to search a file. But, ... why type everytime class name for CtrlP instead of "grep" directly to composer's auto-generated files?</p>

<p>First of all, I started to grep a class name in composer folder:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
grep ParticularClassName ./vendor/composer -R | awk '{print $6}' | awk -F\\' '{print $2}'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This kind of instruction returns a path like <em>/src/Path/To/ParticularClassName.php</em>.</p>

<p>Asking to stackoverflow, ... I discovered the way to retrieve bash output inside a variable:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
let l:fileName = system(l:command)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Finally, I can open in new tab the result.</p>

{% highlight vim %}
let l:fileName = system(l:command)
let l:openFileCommand = 'tabe .' . l:fileName
exec l:openFileCommand
{% endhighlight %}

<p>My contribute to this [vim-composer](https://github.com/vim-php/vim-composer) plugin is a way to open faslty a file, when we want open it. The principle is "when I see a class name, I want to open source file of that class, and I want ask this to composer".</p>
